Using a type systems as strongs as Haskell's feels very similar to the way
in which algrebraic proofs are done: you basically expand and reduce expresions
using the definitions until reaching the target. When types are set in such a way
_filling what type checks_ has the unvoidable feeling of an algebraic proof.

In a sense, every get set at the moment we put our abstractions in place.
